# Astro-UI Docs Template

Each Component created within the Astro-ui monorepo needs to have its own accompanying set of documents to provide extra contextual information on the Component, addressing simple questions such as:

- What it is
- What it does
- How it does it
- How to use it
- When and Where to use it

These pages will have a shared Template, where FrontMatter tags are shared between the pages and their respective frontend Astro site.

## FrontMatter Template

This is the Template to be placed at the top of the front-matter of each doc page.

```astro
---
title: ""
api_title: ""
meta_title: ""
description: "" 
meta_description: ""
page_number: 0
next_page: ""
previous_page: ""
featured_image: ""

```

### So many Titles ðŸ˜±

There is a slight method to this madness. The context of each page and their titles really depends on their location within the UI of the site.

Here is an individual explaination of what 'title' does exactly on the UI.

### `title:string` 

This is the document `<title>`, a long form title that describes the page content.

### `api_title:string`

Our `api/` section contains pages with titles like `@do` and `@observers` etc. These are only used within our API section on the UI. This way, we can place the methods and their special titles into the `<sidebar>` and `<headings>` of the UI.

### `meta_title:string`

The desired SEO optimized title for our pages can vary from the page title. To separate this concern of SEO from interfering with the visual titles of the page, we have a custom field to help empower the SEO narrative.

### description:string

This is a long form description of the contents on the page: a short abstract of what is on the page, what it seeks to convey and other content that is valuable to the user.

### meta_description:string

This is a shorter more condensed form of the description field, used for SEO and meta content for the Social headers of the page. This is intended to be limited to 50 words or fewer. 

### page_number:number

This manually controls the order of each page to avoid the need to sort pages in the UI.

### next_page:string

A Link to the next page in relation to the current page in question. This is used to inform the `<next>` navigation button of the coming page to load.

### previous_page:string

A Link to the previous page to the current page in question. Again used to inform the `<prev>` page navigation.

### featured_image:string

A Link to a featured image, located on a CDN or other online resource.


# Page Title

Introduce the content, short and sweet. Only a couple of sentences long at most.

Next up we seek to build on the previous paragraph by adding some key points of the document. 

## Clear Titles

Titles convey more value than the text that follows.

When using titles to describe sequences of code, do so in the following manner:

`property : type `

By displaying the type associated with the property we can inform the reader of the meta information that they need in order to be able to use the property properly and quickly. This helps to reduce the cognitive overhead for our readers

### Code Blocks

Code blocks should be written using the `lang='astro || tsx' ` preference. Since our code examples for XElement are be written in Astro, we leverage Prism in the UI to help provide syntax support.

## Articles

Always use `-----` to help break up the page into smaller articles. This segmenting of information allows you to visually organize concepts and to maintain readability and structure of the page.

### References

Any Links used to external sources should be suitably linked in the footnotes of the page. We do not wish to distract our readers mid-sentence with an external link, but rather to refer them to the resource used in the body of the documentation at the end.

## Next Steps

Readers need to be told what to do next; it helps prime them as they move between pages.
Concluding what we have achieved on the page, then inform them of what is coming up in the following page. This way their expectations are set and they in the best possible state to continue.

## Footnotes

Any referenced material used within the page needs to be adequately referenced at the bottom of each page, using the APA standard for citations of websites and content material. These footnotes can also include any additional authors comments along with the reference.
