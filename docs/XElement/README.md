# XElement Docs Overview

This directory contains all the documentation pertaining to the use of `astro-xelement`.

Here you can view the `raw` resources and content that powers our documentation site, located in `www/xelement`.

## Directory Structure

The Documentation for `astro-xelement` is set out in the following manner:

## [`induction/`](/induction/)

Every project has its own unique way of introducing new developers to their creations. For XElement it is no different. We wish for you to be suitably brought up to speed with our product.

Our short induction guides to XElement will get you up and running with the core concepts of XElement, and will describe how to go about utilizing the power that it provides fellow Astronauts when building in Astro.

## [`api/`](/api/)

The `api/` directory is XElement's main reference repository. Here you will find all the technical writings, information and more detailed code explanations for each of XElement's methods and behaviors.

If you have any issues or require additional support when utilizing XElement, it is within this `api/` directory you should be able find your answers.

## [`guides/`](/guides)

The [`guides/`](/guides/) directory is where we wish to provide you with supportive examples and instructions to help you get quickly using XElement in your own project.

Creating components in Astro can be either daunting or exceedingly easy, and that depends on many factors. Our guides can help you expand your ability to write good Astro.

The methods we document can often be used in writing Astro components even without XElement as our examples are in JavaScript, using only standard and conventional methods that you will find practiced elsewhere.

## [`blog`](/blog/)

Where the informal and the verbose is given space. Technical documentation is aimed at reaching readers with "more stuff, less fluff" who want to look something up quickly and get right back to work. We feel that there is also space for a more informal, less hurried style of writing that can help tell XElement's story, and help explain XElement to others in a different light.

This also gives us a slightly different platform to be able to discuss further developments and all things XElement, outwith the scope of the technical literature found elsewhere in these docs.

## Epilogue

These documents are a living form. They will change and content will grow over time, driven by the authors and interested parties of the project.

It would be always be a pleasure of ours to help receive content and be able to assist other users of XElement into contributing to the project.

XElement is our gift to other Astronauts, and as with gifts, there is no expected return. We just hope that you enjoy using XElement within your Astro projects, and we would be delighted to hear your stories and see your creations in the wild. So, please do share them with us, via our GitHub!
